Inner solar system is more dense than outer part, so logarithmic map is popular for universe illustration.
But there is a common mistake in many logarithmic maps, like this one:

Think about this: where is the right place for a sun probe whose distance from the sun less than 0.1 AU (say, 0.02 AU) in the map?

The key problem is the fact: log(0) = -∞，so maybe we simply cannot plot the sun in the map?
No, certainly we can.
And even more, by logarithm we can plot the entire universe into a finite map.
After all, all quantities in physics are finite.

Let's begin from the planck length.

[^1]: Considering the [T-duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-duality), space in scale less than 1 planck length may be equal to that greater than 1 planck length (R <=> 1/R). So God may be homeless in that case.
[^2]: The vast blank area hints that the present theory may omit some significant existences.
[^3]: Notice that woman is on the right, so she is taller in fact.
[^4]: I bet you live here now.
[^5]: Here I adopt the theory of [Eternal inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_inflation)
